# @environment

The `@environment` decorator specifies environment variables for a step.

Note that `@environment` is mainly useful for setting special environment variables that need to be present when a container launched by `@batch` or `@kubernetes` starts, which happens before any user code is executed. Variables that are needed after the user code has started can be set as usual in Python:
```
import os
os.environ['SOME_VAL'] = "some value"
```

To set credentials and other secret as environment variables, [see the `@secrets` decorator](/api/step-decorators/secrets).
