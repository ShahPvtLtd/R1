# @timeout

The `@timeout` decorator specifies for how long a step should execute before it is interrupted.

You can use it to handle tasks that may get stuck, or to set a time-budget for a step. For more information, see [Dealing with Failures](/scaling/failures).

<Description summary="Specifies a timeout for your step." extended_summary="This decorator is useful if this step may hang indefinitely.\n\nThis can be used in conjunction with the `@retry` decorator as well as the `@catch` decorator.\nA timeout is considered to be an exception thrown by the step. It will cause the step to be\nretried if needed and the exception will be caught by the `@catch` decorator, if present.\n\nNote that all the values specified in parameters are added together so if you specify\n60 seconds and 1 hour, the decorator will have an effective timeout of 1 hour and 1 minute." />
