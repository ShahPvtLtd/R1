# Inspecting Events

Events provide an additional layer of observability in production systems. By
following a trail of events, you can inspect what was triggered, when, and by
whom.

## Accessing events through Client API

You can inspect the event(s) with the Client API that exposes
[the `MetaflowTrigger` object](/api/client#metaflowtrigger) for every
event-triggered run. For instance, we can inspect the event that triggered a
production run `ModelRefreshFlow/argo-modelrefreshflow-rlpgc`:

```python
from metaflow import namespace, Run
namespace(None)
Run('ModelRefreshFlow/argo-modelrefreshflow-rlpgc').trigger.event
```

Remember that `namespace(None)` sets
[the global namespace](/scaling/tagging#global-namespace) which is
required to inspect production runs e.g. in a notebook. This will print
out metadata about the event:

```
MetaflowEvent(name='data_updated',
			  id='ca75a1a4-91de-40c2-944c-0b39436c721e',
			  timestamp=datetime.datetime(2023, 5, 15, 19, 50, 43),
			  type='event')
```

Find a description of all fields in [the related API documentation](#).

### Dealing with multiple triggers

If a run was triggered by multiple events, you can [inspect specific
`MetaflowEvent` by name](/api/client#Trigger.__getitem__):

```
run.trigger['data_updated'].name
```

Or, if a run was triggered by multiple flows when using `@trigger_on_finish`,
you can inspect a specific triggering `Run` by its flow name:

```
run.trigger['FirstFlow'].data.model
```

### Following a trail of runs

When flows are connected with `@trigger_on_finish`, you can use
`MetaflowTrigger` to follow a chain of triggered runs. Consider this chain of
flows:

```
ETLFlow → TrainingFlow → PredictionFlow
```

We can walk backwards from the latest run of `PredictionFlow` back to the
triggering run of `ETLFlow`:

```python
etl_run = Flow('PredictionFlow').latest_run.trigger.run.trigger.run
```

## Events in the Metaflow UI

If you have deployed
[the Metaflow
GUI](https://netflixtechblog.com/open-sourcing-a-monitoring-gui-for-metaflow-75ff465f0d60),
you can view metadata about triggers right in the UI. The circles with arrows
inside indicate event-triggered runs:

```mdx-code-block
import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';
```
